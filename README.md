# TwitchYapBotInstaller-Rust
This bot reads everything in your twitch chat and learns how to speak. Just type "!yap" in chat. This is a Windows only application.

![yap example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e3da20f-a635-4749-a04a-83609ac17a40)

## How to install
- Download and install the latest version of [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/fosterbarnes/TwitchYapBotInstaller-Rust/releases/download/v5.0.2/Yap.Bot.Installer.v5.0.2.exe)
- After it's installed, run the shortcut from your desktop or start menu app list. Happy yappin'
- The install will live at `YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\YapBot`. User specified install locations are planned for the future

## How it works
- Train Yap Bot by just typing in chat. All chatter's messages will be added to the database
- When Yap Bot is run, it'll use previous chat messages to formulate a new, randomized message
- In addition to being able to run the bot with "!yap", you can also give it a starting point for the sentance it generates. e.g. "!yap dingus"
- These messages can only start with a word that has previously started a chat message, so don't expect every word to work unless it has been indexed
- You can "train" the bot by feeding it chat messages with a starting word you'd like to add with the database. e.g. "dingus poop fart butt"

## How it's made
- The core script is built on [TwitchMarkovChain](https://github.com/fosterbarnes/TwitchMarkovChain) in python. Many, many details and "hidden" options are listed on this repo
- The installer, client app and updater are built using Rust

## Components
- `Yap Bot Installer v5.0.2.exe` is responsible for making sure python and necessary dependencies are installed, installing the included binaries (`TwitchYapBot.exe` and `YapBotUpdater.exe`) to `User\AppData\Roaming\YapBot`
- `TwitchYapBot.exe` is responsible for running the python chat bot, (`TwitchMarkovChain.py`) showing its output, shutting it down, restarting it, and editing its settings. In Yap Bot's previous rendition, these settings had to be changed manually in a .json file
- `YapBotUpdater.exe` responsible for automatically updating `TwitchYapBot.exe` to the newest version
